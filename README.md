Processing
==========

This is the official source code for the Processing Development Environment (PDE), 
the 'core' and the libraries that are included with the download. 

If you have found a bug in the Processing software, you can file it here under the “issues” tab. 
If it relates to JavaScript mode, please use [their issue tracker](https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/).

The processing-web repository contains reference, examples, and the site. 
(Please file issues there if they're in regard to anyonthing on the site, 
the examples, or the reference.)

Someday maybe I'll even take the time to update the build instructions, write code style guidelines, 
fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

But in the meantime, I ask for your patience, participation, and patches.
