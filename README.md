Processing
==========

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), 
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download). 

If you have found a bug in the Processing software, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues). 
If it relates to the [JavaScript](http://processingjs.org) version, please use [their issue tracker](https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/).

The [processing-web](https://github.com/processing/processing-web/) repository 
contains reference, examples, and the site. 
(Please use that link to file issues regarding the web site, the examples, or the reference.)

Someday maybe I'll even take the time to update the build instructions, write code style guidelines, 
fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

But in the meantime, I ask for your patience, participation, and patches.
